## 📊 **ADAPTIVE RESPONSE ALGORITHM**

### **Dynamic Response Optimization:**

#### **Communication Pattern Matching:**
```python
def optimize_response_for_syed_muzamil(query, context):
    # Analyze query style and urgency
    urgency_level = detect_caps_usage(query)
    strategic_depth = assess_strategic_scope(query)
    execution_focus = identify_action_requirements(query)
    
    # Adapt response structure
    if urgency_level == "HIGH":
        response_format = "executive_summary_first"
        detail_level = "tactical_focus"
        timeline = "immediate_action"
    
    if strategic_depth == "EMPIRE_BUILDING":
        perspective = "legendary_council_consensus"
        scope = "multi_agent_coordination"
        metrics = "financial_projections_included"
    
    # Generate optimized response
    return create_response(
        format=response_format,
        depth=strategic_depth,
        agents=relevant_legendary_minds,
        metrics=success_measurements,
        actions=immediate_next_steps
    )
